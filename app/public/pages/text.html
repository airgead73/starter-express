  <h2>Brainstorm Your Ideas</h2>

  <p>Brainstorming is any form of writing or drawing that allows you to generate ideas. Brainstorming is particularly
    useful if you do not have a clear idea of what you want to write. The object is to generate as many ideas as
    possible so that you can find possible directions for your paper.</p>

  <p>Start by writing down the topic you’d like to write about. Then write down any ideas that come to mind about the
    topic. The quantity of ideas is more important than their quality—the more ideas you come up with, the more you have
    to choose from.</p>

  <p>Don’t censor any ideas. Wait until the end of the process to eliminate bad ideas.</p>

  <p>Go ahead and consider wild ideas. You can toss them later if they don’t work, but wild ideas can sometimes spark
    creative ideas that will.
    Feel free to combine ideas to come up with new, maybe improved, ideas.After you’ve generated as many ideas as you
    can think of, start narrowing them down. Toss those that you think are unworkable, do not interest you, do not fit
    well with the other ideas, or will be difficult to cover within the scope of your paper.</p>

  <h3>Tips</h3>

  <p>You can brainstorm by yourself, with another person, or with a small group of people. Often, others will think of
    ideas for your paper that you might not have discovered on your own.</p>

  <p>Save the ideas you brainstormed, even if you don’t use them all. As you write and revise your paper, you may find
    you want to use one or two of the ideas you rejected initially. Or if you are stuck in your writing, one of your
    rejected ideas may spark more ideas that can help you continue with your paper.</p>

  <h3>Resources</h3>

  <p>There are several online mind-mapping tools that can help you brainstorm, including these free ones:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>With Coggle, you have immediate access to a visual representation of your ideas. If you like to collaborate, you
      can invite others to contribute to your mind map as you brainstorm.</li>
    <li>Popplet creates less artistic but more cleanly designed mind maps. If you like organization and dislike clutter,
      Popplet may be the best tool for you. This tool works well on mobile devices and tablets.</li>
    <li>
      If you live your life in the Google Cloud, you can download MindMup 2. This tool gets a lot of praise from users
      because it is simple, intuitive, and easy to learn.

  </ul>

  <h2>Write Your Thesis</h2>

  <p>A thesis statement is a sentence that states the topic and purpose of your paper. Your thesis is a response or
    answer to a question, a statement that indicates your argument, or what conclusion you have reached about your
    paper’s topic. Your essay will be an extension of your thesis statement, in which you explain, support, and apply
    your topic very specifically.</p>

  <p>A good thesis statement will direct the structure of your essay and will allow your reader to understand the ideas
    you will discuss within your paper. Your thesis should be stated somewhere in the opening paragraphs of your paper,
    most often as the last sentence of the introduction. Often, a thesis will be one sentence, but for complex subjects
    you may find it more effective to break the thesis statement into two sentences.</p>

  <p>The type of thesis statement you write will depend on the type of paper you are writing: argumentative, analytical,
    or expository (Table 3.1).</p>

  <table>
    <caption>Table 3.1 Different types of thesis statements</caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Type of paper</th>
        <th>Thesis statement</th>
        <th>Example</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Argumentative <small>making a claim</small></td>
        <td>An argumentative thesis states the topic of your paper, your position on the topic, and the reasons you have
          for taking that position.</td>
        <td>Technology has decreased our level of connectedness to others because it allows us to disconnect from the
          people in our physical environment and it does not foster the social skills needed to help us to connect to
          those around us.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Analytical <small>analyzing a claim</small></td>
        <td>An analytical thesis states the topic of your paper, what specifically you analyzed, and the conclusion(s)
          you reached as a result of that analysis.</td>
        <td>An analysis of alternatives to fossil fuel energies indicates that a better option is the use of solar and
          wind power.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Expository <small>explaining a topic</small></td>
        <td>An expository thesis statement states the topic of your paper and lists the key aspects of your topic that
          you will discuss in the paper.</td>
        <td>Factors related to student success include effective time management, motivation, and family support.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>As you progress through the writing process, you may find that you change your mind about the direction of your
    paper. In this case, simply go back and modify your thesis statement. Most writers do not finalize their thesis
    statement until the last draft of their paper, so think about your thesis as merely a starting guideline that is
    flexible and subject to change.</p>

  <h2>Write Your Introduction</h2>

  <p>Introductions and conclusions are important components of any essay. They bookend the claims made in the body
    paragraphs by first explaining what points will be made (in the introduction) and then summarizing what points were
    made (in the conclusion).</p>

  An <strong>introduction</strong> lets your reader know what he or she can expect from your paper. Your introduction
  should grab your reader’s attention, introduce your topic, and explain your purpose.

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Begin with a hook</strong> that grabs your reader’s attention and introduces the general topic of your
      paper. A hook can take the form of an interesting quotation (that you must cite), a brief story that captures the
      essence of the topic, a rhetorical question, a direct statement, or an attention-grabbing fact or statistic.</li>
    <li>Next, <strong>make a statement or two about the more focused topic</strong> the paper will expand on. This part
      of the introduction can include background on the topic that helps to establish its context.</li>
    <li>Finally, <strong>state your thesis</strong>. Your thesis statement should be structured so that if it were to
      stand on its own, it would let your reader know your specific topic, the claim you make about that topic, and the
      reasons you have for making that claim.</li>
  </ol>
